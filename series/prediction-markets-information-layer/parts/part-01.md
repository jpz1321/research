## Abstract

Prediction markets are often discussed as if their primary function were to predict outcomes. This framing is intuitive and widespread, but it obscures what prediction markets actually do when they function well.

This paper argues that prediction markets should be understood as an **information layer**: systems that aggregate dispersed belief under incentive constraints and express that aggregation as probabilistic price. Unlike polls, expert commentary, or narrative-driven media analysis, prediction markets require participants to translate belief into risk-bearing action, introducing accountability into the process of collective inference.

Rather than treating market prices as forecasts or declarations of truth, the paper frames them as **belief equilibria**—signals shaped by incentives, participation, and survival over time. Using the 2024 U.S. presidential election as a case study, it explores why markets and polls can both be "correct" while appearing to contradict each other, and why that distinction matters for interpretation.

The paper is intentionally **non-academic**. It draws from direct experience building trading infrastructure on prediction markets since 2023, supported by foundational ideas from market design and forecasting research. Its aim is not to defend prediction markets uncritically, but to clarify how they function, how their signals should be interpreted, and where misunderstanding creates more risk than inaccuracy.
