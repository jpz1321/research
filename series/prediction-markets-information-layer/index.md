# Prediction Markets as an Information Layer

This research series examines prediction markets as a distinct **information layer**—systems that aggregate dispersed belief under incentive constraints and express that aggregation as probabilistic price.

Rather than treating prediction markets as forecasting tools or speculative products, the papers in this series focus on how markets function epistemically: how belief becomes price, how structure shapes signal quality, and how interpretation determines whether markets are useful or misleading.

The work is intentionally **non-academic**. It draws from direct experience building trading infrastructure on prediction markets since 2023, supported by foundational ideas from market design and forecasting research. The author is the founder of Spredd Markets, a UI and routing layer built on Polymarket and Kalshi for ecosystems not natively supported by those platforms.

Each paper is written as a standalone research note, but together they form a coherent framework for understanding prediction markets as information systems.

## Parts

### Part 1 — From Opinion to Price
**Status:** Published  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Focus:** Foundational framing of prediction markets as an information layer rather than a forecasting tool. Introduces belief equilibria, the survival filter that makes markets informative, and why accuracy is the wrong first question. Uses the 2024 U.S. presidential election to illustrate why markets and polls can both be "correct" while appearing to contradict each other.

### Part 2 — When Market Structure Becomes Meaning
**Status:** In progress  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Focus:** How different prediction market platforms produce meaningfully different signals. Compares Kalshi and Polymarket across fees, position limits, resolution mechanisms, and participation constraints. Uses 2024 election data—including the Théo position concentration case and the Clinton/Huang Vanderbilt study—to show why price divergence between platforms often reflects structural differences rather than inefficiency.

### Part 3 — Resolution and the Architecture of Trust
**Status:** In progress  
**Focus:** How resolution mechanisms shape what markets can credibly price. Compares centralized resolution (Kalshi's internal teams, AP as source) with decentralized resolution (UMA's Optimistic Oracle, token-holder voting). Examines controversial resolutions, ambiguity pricing, and how trust in outcomes feeds back into pre-resolution trading behavior.

### Part 4 — Where Markets Work and Where They Break
**Status:** Planned  
**Focus:** Domain-specific analysis of prediction market performance. Examines why markets excel in some contexts (elections, sports, economic indicators with clear resolution) and struggle in others (long-horizon events, ambiguous outcomes, low-liquidity niches). Identifies structural conditions that predict informational quality.

### Part 5 — Building on the Information Layer
**Status:** Planned  
**Focus:** Practical considerations for developers and institutions building on prediction market infrastructure. Covers aggregation across platforms, routing and execution, handling divergence, and designing interfaces that surface signal rather than obscure it. Draws directly from experience building Spredd Markets.

---

### Part 6 — Institutions, Incentives, and Responsible Use
**Status:** Planned  
**Focus:** How prediction markets can—and cannot—be responsibly integrated into institutional decision-making. Examines media partnerships, policy applications, and the risks of treating market prices as authoritative rather than informative. Addresses manipulation concerns, reflexivity, and the gap between what markets measure and what institutions need.
