# Prediction Markets as an Information Layer

This research series examines prediction markets as a distinct **information layer**—systems that aggregate dispersed belief under incentive constraints and express that aggregation as probabilistic price.

Rather than treating prediction markets as forecasting tools or speculative products, the papers in this series focus on how markets function epistemically: how belief becomes price, how signals should be interpreted, and how structure, incentives, and attention shape informational quality.

The work is intentionally **non-academic**. It draws primarily from practical experience building on top of prediction markets, writing long-form research, and observing market behavior over time, rather than from formal econometric or statistical modeling.

Each paper is written as a standalone research note, but together they form a coherent framework for understanding prediction markets as information systems.
