# Research Notes

This site hosts independent research on prediction markets, information aggregation, and market-based forecasting systems.

The work published here is intentionally **non-academic**. It is grounded in practical experience building on top of prediction markets and writing long-form research, rather than in formal econometric or statistical modeling. The focus is on interpretation, incentives, market structure, and how probabilistic signals should be understood and used in real-world decision-making.

This is a living research archive. Papers are published when they are complete, not on a fixed schedule.

## Research Series

### Prediction Markets as an Information Layer

A six-part research series examining prediction markets as a distinct information layer—how belief becomes price, how signals should be interpreted, and how market design, incentives, and attention shape outcomes.

- **Part 1: From Opinion to Price**  
  A foundational paper arguing that prediction markets should be understood as an information layer rather than as forecasting tools.

## How to Use This Research

The papers here are best read as **decision-support context**, not as predictions or prescriptions. Market prices are treated as signals—inputs into judgment—rather than as authoritative answers.

Readers are encouraged to interpret probabilities with attention to market structure, participation, and uncertainty.
