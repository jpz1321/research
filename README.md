This repository contains independent research on prediction markets, information aggregation, and market-based forecasting systems.

The work here is intentionally **non-academic**. It is grounded in practical experience building on top of prediction markets, writing long-form research, and studying how market prices function as signals under uncertainty—rather than in formal econometric or statistical modeling.

The goal is not to promote prediction markets uncritically, but to clarify how they work, how they should be interpreted, and where they are commonly misunderstood.

## Research Series

### Prediction Markets as an Information Layer
A six-part research series examining prediction markets as a distinct information system—how belief becomes price, how signals should be interpreted, and how market structure, incentives, and attention shape outcomes.

- **Part 1:** From Opinion to Price  
  Foundational framing of prediction markets as an information layer rather than a forecasting tool.

(Additional parts will be published sequentially.)

## Notes
The `notes/` directory contains shorter research notes and standalone observations that do not belong to a longer series.

## Format & Versioning
- Long-form research is published as **PDF-first** artifacts.
- Each paper includes a version number and publication date.
- Minor revisions increment version numbers (e.g., v1.0 → v1.1).
- Older versions remain accessible for reference.
